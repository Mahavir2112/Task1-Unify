# Text-Input

## Overview

- The `extract_text_inputs.py` file takes a Figma response JSON as input, extracts all text input components, and stores them in `text_inputs.json`.

- The `convert_to_unify.py` file takes `text_inputs.json` as input, converts it to the Unify Apps JSON format, and stores the result in `e_component.json`.
